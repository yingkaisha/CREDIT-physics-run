## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction models are powerful tools for medium-range forecasts but often lack physical consistency, leading to outputs that violate conservation laws. This study introduces a set of novel physics-based schemes designed to enforce the conservation of global dry air mass, moisture budget, and total atmospheric energy in AI weather prediction models. The schemes are highly modular, allowing for seamless integration into a wide range of AI models regardless of their architectures. Forecast experiments are conducted to demonstrate the benefit of conservation schemes using FuXi, a state-of-the-art AI weather prediction model on 1.0$^\circ$ grid spacing. Verification results show that the conservation schemes can guide the model to produce forecasts that obey conservation laws. The forecast skills of upper-air and surface variables are also improved, with longer forecast lead times receiving larger benefits. Notably, large performance gains are found in the total precipitation forecasts, owing to the reduction of drizzle bias. The proposed conservation schemes establish a foundation for the implementation of other physics-based schemes in the future. They also provide a new way to integrate atmospheric domain knowledge into the design and refinement of AI weather prediction models.
